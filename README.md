= Distribution of Natural Resources in Minecraft Pi

This is a science fair project for my son Weilun to focus on the subject of
Computer Science -- Statistics.  I'll be doing the heavy lifting but the focus
is to introduce concepts of counting, averaging, and graphs leveraging his
passion for Minecraft.

Thanks for any feedback from Minecraft fans and programmers, and for any other
science fair moms and dads, please feel free to use this.  We are using the
simple MIT License ( http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT ) so have at.
